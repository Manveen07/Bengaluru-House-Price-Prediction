# Bengaluru-House-Price-Prediction
This project aims to predict house prices in Bengaluru using a machine learning model. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to accurately estimate property prices based on various features such as location, total square footage, number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms (BHK). 
Project Overview
Problem Statement

The real estate market in Bengaluru is vast and diverse, with property prices varying significantly based on location, amenities, and other factors. Predicting house prices accurately can help buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions.
Data

The dataset used for this project includes various features of houses in Bengaluru, such as:

    Location: Area or locality of the property.
    Total Sqft: Total square footage of the property.
    Bath: Number of bathrooms.
    BHK: Number of bedrooms, halls, and kitchens.
    Price: The price of the property (target variable).

Key Features

    Location: Categorical feature representing the area where the property is located.
    Total Sqft: Numerical feature representing the size of the property.
    Bath: Numerical feature indicating the number of bathrooms.
    BHK: Numerical feature representing the number of bedrooms, halls, and kitchens.

Tools and Technologies

    Python: Programming language used for the project.
    Pandas and NumPy: Libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
    Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for model training and evaluation.
    Matplotlib and Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.

Project Steps

    Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, converting data types, and preprocessing categorical variables.
    Feature Engineering: One-hot encoding for categorical variables and scaling for numerical features.
    Model Training: Using different machine learning models, including linear regression and random forest regressor, to train and predict house prices.
    Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics like R^2 score.
    Prediction Function: A function to predict house prices based on input features like location, total square footage, number of bathrooms, and BHK.
